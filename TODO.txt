MAYBE LATER:
* refactor out view stuff
* empty things shouldn't trigger nothing but help
* for notification, use either who created item and/or @callout if present
* up should let you edit last message
* edit should allow you to edit the text
* auto build of bot a la rentpath-node
* make sure to do all of the stuff on https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting
  - especially HTML entity escapes

SOON:
* add shared secret to
  - Validating the command on page https://api.slack.com/slash-commands
* update README
* imrpove readme to include installing service
* add mysql / persistance / ETS
* auto-scale to 1 each
* honor the application token
* add nginx https
* if items go from 1 to 0, the broadcast still happens
* remove *bold* from next in queue broadcast
* speed up builds -- not enough caching
